# Predicting Vehicle Weight and Road Slope

This project aimed to develop a personal predictive model for vehicle weight and road slope using Python and machine learning techniques. The dataset used contained 9 input signals and 8500 data samples.

## Project Overview

The following tasks were performed in this project:

1. Data analysis, including calculating basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, and quantiles) and computing frequency and percentage of unique values.
2. Visualization of data distribution and checking for outliers using histograms and boxplots.
3. Examination of relationships using heatmaps and mutual information scores.
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets and evaluating Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and SVM algorithms.

## Results

The project achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.96 for vehicle weight and 0.84 for road slope when compared to the instructor's test set.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Timeline

This project was completed between October 2023 and December 2023.
